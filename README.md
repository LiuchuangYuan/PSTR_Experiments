Experiments for the Panel Smooth Transition Regression Models
-------------------------------------------------------------

provides R codes for all the experiments (size and power, LM tests, wild bootstrap and wild cluster bootstrap tests) in the paper "Panel Smooth Transition Regression Models".

The codes are written and  when I was working as a post-doc at CORE, Université catholique de Louvain in 2014. All the experiments are run on (special thank to) the [C.E.C.I.](http://www.ceci-hpc.be/) (Consortium des Équipements de Calcul Intensif).

In the following, you can find the descriptions for all folders. In each folder, you can find the codes. For more details about the codes, open and read the comments part in the header part.

### EXPECV

Experiments for Empirical critical values

-   size, to sample from the null hypothesis
-   the power of homogeneity test

### EXPERIMENTS

All the experiments except the wild bootstrap and wild cluster bootstrap

### EXPWARP

All the experiments for wild cluster bootstrap

### SENS

Experiments for the sensitivity of the LM test based on different parameters

### WBPOWER 11-22

All the experiments for wild bootstrap

### WBSIZE 1-2

Experiments for size of homogeneity test
